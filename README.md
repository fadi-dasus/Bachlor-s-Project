# Bachlor-s-Project
Medical errors are difficult to detect and confront, especially when hospital doctors work under
pressure, e.g. in the Emergency Department. Data analysis and Machine learning models can
assist doctors in reducing errors in medical diagnoses. The objective of this project is to develop
a system that assists doctors in detecting pneumonia cases based on X-ray images in the
Emergency Department at Vejle Sygehus. This project examines different algorithms and
techniques in order to achieve the best accuracy score. It compares the accuracy score obtained
from training 117 different models. The models belong to the following algorithms: Convolutional
Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. The best model obtained
belongs to the CNN algorithm which has the following accuracy scores: The Accuracy rate is
0.96, Sensitivity score is 0.99 and the Specificity is 0.87. The system developed in this project
follows the microservice architecture design pattern which results in a scalable system. Moreover,
storing the X-ray images in the file system and keeping a path in a database was efficient for this
project. The system uses HTTP protocol for synchronous communication and AMQP for
asynchronous communication, which is beneficial for creating loosely coupled services in the
microservices architecture. The results achieved as to the Accuracy rate, the Sensitivity score
and the Specificity rate listed above proved higher and more efficient than hoped for when the
project was launched. It can be concluded that Data analysis and Machine learning models are
beneficial within medical services to reduce errors in medical diagnoses. It is recommended that
the system created in this project is further developed and refined to help make diagnoses more
accurate in hospitals in general and in emergency departments specifically.
